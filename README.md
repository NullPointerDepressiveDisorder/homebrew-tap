# 🍺 Homebrew Tap

Custom Homebrew casks by [NullPointerDepressiveDisorder](https://github.com/NullPointerDepressiveDisorder).

## ⚠️ Deprecation Notice

**MiddleDrag** has been added to the official [homebrew-cask](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask) repository and is now available directly without needing this tap.

You can now install it with:
```bash
brew install --cask middledrag
```

This tap is maintained for legacy support but is no longer required.

## Usage

```bash
brew tap nullpointerdepressivedisorder/tap
```

## Available Casks

| Cask | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [middledrag](https://github.com/NullPointerDepressiveDisorder/MiddleDrag) | Middle-click and middle-drag via three-finger trackpad gestures |

### MiddleDrag

Three-finger trackpad gestures for middle-click and middle-drag on macOS. Works alongside system gestures like Mission Control.

```bash
brew install --cask middledrag
```

**Requirements:** macOS 15.0 (Sequoia) or later

## Updates

Casks are automatically updated when new releases are published to their respective repositories.
